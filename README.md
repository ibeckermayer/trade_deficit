Thinking a bit more about Buffett’s article that I posted elsewhere ([1]), my understanding of trade deficits is a bit more nuanced.

What I already understood was that a trade deficit with a single other entity taken in isolation is meaningless. The classic way to think
about this is to recognize that you as an individual are in a “trade deficit” with your grocery store. You buy all of your groceries from
them, and they buy nothing from you. Yet it would be absurd to say they’re “ripping you off” or that you’d be far better off producing all of
your own food. This is just the economics of trade 101, specialization, comparative advantage, etc, its positive sum and makes us all
wealthier.

Where it gets more complex is looking at the overall trade deficit. In the individual analogy, this is analogous to analyzing my overall cash
flow for a given time period (say a year). My “trade deficit” with my grocer isn’t a problem for me so long as I make it up elsewhere. In the
common case this is made up with the “trade surplus” I have with my employer. I “produce” my labor and they pay me for it, which is ideally
the surplus I use to pay my grocer.

However if I’m at an overall “trade deficit” for a given year, then that means that I’m spending more than I’m earning. In that case, the
extra money I’m spending (my overall trade deficit) must be coming from somewhere: either going into debt, selling off assets, or dipping
into savings. Either way, my net worth is decreasing over time, and thus the path I’m on is unsustainable.

Usually an individual would be naturally limited by how much they can do this. They’d use up all their savings, sell off all their assets,
and burn up any good will with creditors who would check them on how much debt they can go into. In the US’s case, there was a lot to sell
off, because we were a very asset rich country. And our ability to borrow has been supercharged, because our central bank is empowered to buy
our debt, and the entire world is addicted to the dollar as a reserve currency for historical reasons, implicit military threats/protection,
and so on.

That's where we are now, the U.S. is a supercharged consumer that's been putting up massive trade deficits for the past 50 years ([2]). We've
done that by going increasingly into debt both individually ([3]) and as a nation ([4]) while selling off assets ([5],[1]), whereas our
savings have been roughly flat ([6]).

In short we're selling what we own and borrowing money from the rest of the world to buy the things we consume. The rest of the world isn't
"ripping us off", if anything they're being very generous by buying our debt and continuing to accept our dollars, despite the abundant
evidence that we aren't producing enough to ever pay it all back, at least not without seriously debasing the dollar. So while Trump's
rhetoric about individual countries "ripping us off" is a total misunderstanding of the trade deficit situation, and leveling tariffs
proportional to the trade deficit is incoherent, it is true that our overall trade deficit is unsustainable and a massive problem, and if we
don't fix it before the rest of the world figures out a way to dump our dollar, the American people are headed for a very painful economic
future.

Other than my commentary on Trump's recent actions, I haven't said much more than what Buffett said in his 2003 article ([1]), but analogizing to an individual did help cement my understanding, and may help others. I also found it odd that the `PMSAVE` FRED data wasn't inflation adjusted, so I created a script to do that and added the plot here.
